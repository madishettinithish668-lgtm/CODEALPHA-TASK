# Simple Rule-Based Chatbot

This is a basic Python chatbot project created as part of **CodeAlpha Task-4**.  
The chatbot uses simple pattern matching logic to respond to user input.

## 💡 Project Description

This chatbot simulates a simple conversation using predefined keyword-based responses.  
It is built using only core Python and runs in the terminal. It can understand basic greetings, questions, and farewells.

## ⚙️ Features

- Responds to greetings (hello, hi, good morning)
- Can answer simple questions like "What is Python?"
- Tells a joke if asked
- Says goodbye when the user types "bye"
- Handles user input in any case format (e.g., "HELLO", "hello", "Hello")

## 🧠 Example Conversation

```
You: HELLO
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

You: WHAT IS PYTHON
Bot: Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity.

You: TELL ME A JOKE
Bot: Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!

You: BYE
Bot: Goodbye! Have a nice day!
```

## 📁 How to Run

1. Save the chatbot code in a `.py` file (e.g., `chatbot.py`)
2. Run it using a Python interpreter:
   ```
   python chatbot.py
   ```
